## 🌞 Overview
The **3D Solar System** is an interactive web-based simulation that visually represents our solar system using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates real-time **planetary rotation, orbit animation, and interactivity** through modern web technologies — offering a visually engaging and educational experience.

## 🧠 Features
- 🪐 **Realistic 3D Orbit Animation** using CSS 3D transforms  
- ☀️ **Central Sun** with orbiting planets  
- 🌍 **Individual Planet Rotation** and self-spin animation  
- 🖱️ **Interactive Controls:** Rotate and zoom using mouse events  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript Animation Logic:** Smooth transitions and orbit mechanics  
- 🎨 **Clean & Responsive UI** built with CSS and HTML5

## 🪄 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure  
- **CSS3** – 3D transforms, orbit animations, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Animation logic and event handling  
- **Netlify** – For live deployment  

---

## 🎮 How It Works
- The **Sun** is fixed at the center.  
- Each **planet** is animated to orbit around the Sun using CSS keyframes.  
- **JavaScript** handles user interactions like zooming, rotating the view, and adjusting animation speed.  

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Add **planet information popups** on click  
- Integrate **real-time orbital data** (NASA APIs)  
- Add **background stars** and **comets** for realism  
- Implement **dark/light theme toggle**

#### index.html: 
#### The main HTML file that contains the basic layout of the solar system.
#### styles.css: Contains the styles and 3D effects that give life to the planets and solar system.
#### main.js: The JavaScript logic responsible for animating the planets' orbits, handling interactions, and managing the state of the system.
#### img /: Folder for any images or other assets used (optional).
#### CSS 3D Transforms: Used to rotate the planets and simulate orbital movements.

#### JavaScript Logic: Controls the animation speed, interactivity (rotate, zoom), and handles mouse events (e.g., clicking a planet).
